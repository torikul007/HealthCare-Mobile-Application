This is a basic healthcare app that is developed by using XML and JAVA on Android Studio. For database, SQlite is used.

Overview
Health care is a basic need of every human being. In Bangladesh the health care system
is mainly provided by the government with little or no charge. But this comes with
many complications. The huge number of patients makes it difficult for the government
hospitals to provide them with a quality health care. As a result, thousands of private
hospitals are established with a view to meet the growing need of the masses for a
quality health care. But when one wish to take service from a hospital, he first tries
to collect some information about that hospital. In this project, we will try to make a
mobile application to make health care more convenient for the masses is proposed. The
reason for choosing android platform is that in Bangladesh, the cost of android phone
is reasonable and even poor people can afford to have one. Besides, android phones are
seen widespread and all ages and classes of people are using it without hassle
